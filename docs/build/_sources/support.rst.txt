Common Issues
=============

**Application Won't Start**

*Symptoms*: SACRO Viewer fails to launch or crashes immediately

*Solutions*:
  * Verify your system meets the minimum requirements
  * Try running as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)
  * Check for antivirus software blocking the application
  * Reinstall the application using the latest installer

**Cannot Open Directory**

*Symptoms*: Error message when trying to select an output directory

*Solutions*:
  * Ensure the directory exists and you have read permissions
  * Check that the directory contains files (empty directories may cause issues)
  * Try selecting a different directory to isolate the problem
  * Verify the directory path doesn't contain special characters

**Files Not Displaying Correctly**

*Symptoms*: Output files appear corrupted or don't display properly

*Solutions*:
  * Verify file checksums match expected values
  * Check that files aren't corrupted or locked by other applications
  * Ensure file extensions match their actual content type
  * Try opening files in external applications to verify they're valid

**Missing ACRO Metadata**

*Symptoms*: All outputs appear as "custom" type instead of showing ACRO analysis

*Solutions*:
  * Verify the directory contains a valid ``outputs.json`` file
  * Check that the JSON file is properly formatted and not corrupted
  * Ensure the ACRO version is compatible with SACRO Viewer
  * Try regenerating the ACRO outputs if possible

**Release Package Generation Fails**

*Symptoms*: Error when trying to create the final release ZIP file

*Solutions*:
  * Ensure you have write permissions in the download directory
  * Check available disk space for the release package
  * Verify all approved files are accessible and not locked
  * Try selecting a different download location

Performance Issues
=================

**Slow File Loading**

If SACRO Viewer is slow to load or display files:

* Close other applications to free up system memory
* Try working with smaller directories or fewer files at once
* Ensure your system meets the recommended specifications
* Consider upgrading system RAM if working with large datasets

**Large File Handling**

For very large output files:

* SACRO Viewer may truncate display of extremely large files for performance
* Use the "Open file" button to view large files in external applications
* Consider splitting large outputs into smaller files when possible
* Monitor system memory usage when working with large files

Troubleshooting Steps
====================

**Basic Troubleshooting**

1. **Restart the application** - Close SACRO Viewer completely and relaunch
2. **Check system resources** - Ensure adequate memory and disk space
3. **Verify file permissions** - Confirm you can read the output directory and files
4. **Test with sample data** - Try using the included sample outputs to isolate issues

**Advanced Troubleshooting**

1. **Check application logs** - Look for error messages in system logs or console output
2. **Verify file integrity** - Use checksums to confirm files aren't corrupted
3. **Test different directories** - Try with different output directories to isolate issues
4. **Reinstall application** - Uninstall and reinstall SACRO Viewer with latest version

Known Limitations
================

**File Size Limits**
  Very large files (>200MB) may display slowly or be truncated for performance reasons.

**File Type Support**
  While SACRO Viewer supports common research output formats, some specialized file types may not display correctly.

**Network Connectivity**
  SACRO Viewer is designed to work offline, but some features may require internet access for updates or documentation.
