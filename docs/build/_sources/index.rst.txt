SACRO Viewer: Graphical Output Review Tool
==========================================

SACRO Viewer is a desktop application for reviewing research outputs produced using the ACRO tools. It provides a graphical interface for output checkers to review files, researcher comments, and statistical analysis outcomes in a secure environment.

.. note::
   **Current Version:** v0.1.0 - Cross-platform desktop application with Windows, Linux, and macOS support.

What is SACRO Viewer?
=====================

SACRO Viewer is a desktop application that:

* Loads JSON metadata output by ACRO tools for comprehensive output review
* Displays research outputs with researcher comments and statistical analysis results
* Allows output checkers to approve or reject individual outputs
* Generates zipfiles containing only approved outputs for secure release
* Works in Trusted Research Environments (TREs) without internet connectivity

Core Features
=============

Comprehensive Output Review
---------------------------

* **ACRO Integration**: Automatically detects and loads ACRO-generated metadata
* **File Display**: View various file types including CSV, images, and text files
* **Statistical Context**: See ACRO analysis results including disclosure risk assessments
* **Researcher Comments**: Review comments and justifications provided by researchers
* **Approval Workflow**: Individual approve/reject decisions for each output
* **Secure Release**: Generate zipfiles containing only approved outputs

Design Principles
-----------------

* **Desktop Application**: Runs locally without requiring internet connectivity
* **Cross-platform**: Available for Windows, Linux, and macOS
* **TRE Compatible**: Designed for use in secure Trusted Research Environments
* **User-friendly**: Intuitive graphical interface for non-technical users
* **Secure**: Local processing with no external data transmission
* **Audit Trail**: Maintains records of approval decisions
